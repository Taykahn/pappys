			<div>All About Pappy's Grill &amp; Pub</div>
				<p>Pappy's has been around since June 17, 2005.....that was the date that we, Steve &amp; Michelle Margulies, bought the original Stan &amp; Lou's.  It was quite a change for a couple of mortgage banking professionals. Steve left his "day job" to run Pappy's.....Michelle was keeping hers....just in case!</p>
				<p>We changed the name from Stan &amp; Lou's a few months into our ownership so we could create our own identity.  My son, Brian, used to call me Pappy on occasion and after working with several ideas suggested by many generous-thinking people, we went with the name, Pappy's Grill &amp; Pub.</p>
				<p>We've maintained the core menu from the original owners.  In fact, we named two burgers (Stan's Burger and Lou's Burger) after them and they remain on the menu today.  Our philosophy has been relatively simple:  Offer customers a clean, pleasant place to eat with reasonable prices.  We figured that such a concept would work.  We also figured that adding Steve's New Yorker personality to the mix would make it all interesting.</p>
				<p>The replacement of virtually all the kitchen equipment in early 2006 was necessary as the lunch and dinner business increased to levels only dreamed of by Steve &amp; Michelle.</p>
				<p>The menu has come a long way since 2005.....several new sandwiches have become as popular as our original, best-selling, Tenderloin.   All of our burgers and hot sandwiches come to the customer served on a buttered, lightly grilled bun.  Several new appetizers have joined the line-up and the recent creation of a new line of Salads has brought a welcome addition to an already fabulous menu.</p>
				<p>We strive to keep your visit to Pappy's an enjoyable and fun experience every time you come in.  So many of our great customers know each other from the outside, but many have met because they make Pappy's their place to eat. Most of our Staff has been with us since the beginning, so we must be doing something right.</p>
				<p>Steve, Michelle and the Gang at Pappy's appreciate your business and thank for visiting our Web Site.</p>
